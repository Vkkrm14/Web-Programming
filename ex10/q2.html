      She considered the birds to be her friends. She'd put out food for them
      each morning and then she'd watch as they came to the feeders to gorge
      themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something ever
      happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to
      put out the food one morning?

      He wandered down the stairs and into the basement. The damp, musty smell
      of unuse hung in the air. A single, small window let in a glimmer of
      light, but this simply made the shadows in the basement deeper. He inhaled
      deeply and looked around at a mess that had been accumulating for over 25
      years. He was positive that this was the place he wanted to live.

    He was after the truth. At least, that's what he told himself. He believed
    it, but any rational person on the outside could see he was lying to
    himself. It was apparent he was really only after his own truth that he'd
    already decided and was after this truth because the facts didn't line up
    with the truth he wanted. So he continued to tell everyone he was after the
    truth oblivious to the real truth sitting right in front of him.

      There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground,
      but Rachael could see movement. She squinted her eyes and peered in the
      direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had spied.
      The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment
      of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to
      take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner of her eye, she would see
      the movement again and begin the process of staring again.
